1) We want control-c to kill the running process 
   but not the shell and 
       not GShell
       
2) Implement the history class
   a) Ever6y command is added to history when sent to shell
   b) for this commands have to be dynamically allocated
   c) implement history.choose by which a user can use up and down arrows and 
      mount to choose a command from history. The chosen command remains intact and copied into 
      a new command that can further be edited.
   d) history.choose is activated when user enters control-h (or something else reasonabke
      when editing a command
      
3) Learn about command completion and use private dialogs with the background shell to implement command completion
4) Write a nicer graphic help mechanism
